# TicTacToe_game
**Introduction** :computer:

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It allows *Two players* as well as *Single player*  to play the game on the same console, taking turns to place their markers ('1' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game notifies players of their turn, checks for win conditions after each move.


***Features***

 :arrow_forward: Console-based: Entirely text-based with no graphical user interface.
 
 :arrow_forward: Two-player: Supports two players taking turns.
 
 :arrow_forward: Win Condition Detection: Checks for winning combinations after each move.
 
 :arrow_forward: Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and prevents illegal moves.

  :arrow_forward: Computer Algorithm Opponent: Test your skills against the computer algorithm, which employs strategic moves based on game conditions.

***Technologies Used***

Java: Core programming language.

Git: Version control system.

GitHub: Hosting repository and project documentation.

:flashlight: ***Usage***

***Gameplay Instructions:*** :red_circle: :yellow_circle: :green_circle:

 :arrow_right: Players are prompted to enter their moves by specifying the row and column of the grid (rows are numberede :0,1,2 and column are numbered: 0,1,2)

:arrow_right: For Single Player mode: You can input '1' when the Game asks you to input.
 
:zap: ***Latest Update*** :zap:

I am  excited to introduce Single-Player Mode with Computer Algorithm to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! Now, you can enjoy a challenging game against our computer opponent, designed to provide a competitive and enjoyable experience.

 ***Future Improvements***
 
 :triangular_flag_on_post:	 Graphical Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
 
 :triangular_flag_on_post:	 Enhanced Algorithm : Improve the difficulty level for Single-Player mode.
 
 :triangular_flag_on_post:	 Bringing Leaderboard concept which will be ranking the players in the Single-Players mode.
