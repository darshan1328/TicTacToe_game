# TicTacToe_game
**Introduction** :computer:

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It allows two players to play the game on the same console, taking turns to place their markers ('1' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game notifies players of their turn, checks for win conditions after each move.
